<h1>Information Visualization - Interactive Data Analysis Tool</h1>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>This exercise will consist in the design and implementation of a interactive visualization tool. The design of this tool, like any other interactive analysis tool, must solve the particular problems that an “end user” or “analyst” has to deal with when facing some data that he wants to analyze in a work session.<p>

<h3>Minimum constraints</h3>
<p>These questions must comply, at least, with the following minimum constraints:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They should involve the use of 3+ different types of plots (idioms) that accurately answer the considered questions</li>
  <li>Some kind of filtering and/or aggregation should be possible in order for a user to be able to focus on the information he finds more interesting.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use of multiple (synchronized) views.</li>
  <li>Integration of the application with some data analysis algorithm.</li>
  <li>Use of specific arrangements for the data under consideration. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Problem Characterization</h3>
<p>We selected the movies industry as our application domain. We thought that it would be interesting to identify the different factors that made a movie successful, not only in terms of popularity but also in terms of profitability.</p>

<p>We observed that people pay special attention to the movies that are better ranked or to the ones that win special premiums, like Oscars. Several factors such as the number of votes, tendencies over time and budgets are important for profitability and popularity, but they do not always guarantee how highly a movie will be rated. In this report, we sought to understand these factors and find new hypothesis about them.</p> 

<p>Since we wanted to find trustful data, we decided to explore the official data set of the IMDb (Internet Movie Database). Our data set contains data related to a large range of movies, from 1893 till 2005. </p>
 
<p>The visualization tool we are presenting in this report is guided by three main questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which genres of movies are most prevalent among the years?</li>
  <li>How has movie budget affected rating?</li>
  <li>How has the number of votes and distribution of average movie rating changed over time?</li>
</ul>
